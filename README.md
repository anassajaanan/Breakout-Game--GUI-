Breakout is a classic arcade game where the player controls a paddle and tries to bounce a ball off of it to break bricks arranged in a wall. The goal is to clear all the bricks and reach a certain score before the ball falls below the paddle.

This project is a implementation of the Breakout game using the Python turtle library.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine in order to run this project. You can download Python 3 from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/).

### Installing

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```python
git clone https://github.com/[USERNAME]/breakout-game.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```python
cd breakout-game
```

### Running the game

To run the game, simply run the `main.py` script using Python:

```python
python main.py
```

## Game Controls

- Use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle left or right.
- Press the spacebar to start the game.

## Gameplay

- The goal of the game is to clear all the bricks in the wall and reach the target score before the ball falls below the paddle.
- You can bounce the ball off the paddle to break the bricks. Different bricks have different point values:
  * Red bricks: 30 points
  * Orange bricks: 20 points
  * Yellow bricks: 10 points
  * Green bricks: 5 points
- If the ball falls below the paddle, you lose a life. You have three lives total.
- If you run out of lives or reach the target score, the game ends.
